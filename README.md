Machine Learning Course Repository

Welcome to the Data Analysis and Machine Learning repository, a comprehensive collection of assignments and labs focused on data analysis, machine learning, and neural networks. This repository provides hands-on exercises in various domains, including population statistics, financial analysis, employee data, car price analysis, obesity dataset analysis, and others.

## Content Overview

### Assignments
- **Assignment 1:** 
  - **Population Statistics Analysis:** Basic statistical operations with NumPy on a small dataset representing city populations. Includes calculating mean, median, standard deviation, and increasing population by 10%.
  - **Financial Analysis:** Using NumPy to analyze daily stock prices for two companies, calculate daily returns, and compare stock prices.
  - **Employee Data Analysis:** Load a CSV dataset with employee information and use Pandas to display data, perform basic statistics, filter and sort data, and group by department.
  
- **Assignment 2:** 
  - **CarPrice Dataset Analysis:** Analyze and visualize features from a car price dataset. Includes dealing with missing data, calculating correlations, and conducting feature analysis for both quantitative and qualitative data.
  
- **Assignment 7:** 
  - **Obesity Dataset Analysis:** Perform data analysis and modeling on the Obesity DataSet.csv. This assignment covers neural network design with Keras API, different machine learning algorithms, and model performance comparisons. Additionally, students prepare a PDF report to describe the analysis, models, and final conclusions.

### Labs
- **Lab 3:** 
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm:** Understand KNN concepts, distance metrics, curse of dimensionality, and implement KNN from scratch using the Iris dataset.
  
- **Lab 4:** 
  - **Linear Regression and Classification with Iris Dataset:** Implement linear regression and perform classification tasks.
  
- **Lab 5:** 
  - **Insurance Data Analysis with Regression Models:** Apply different regression models and regularization techniques on the insurance dataset.
  
- **Lab 6:** 
  - **Support Vector Machines (SVM) Intuition:** Explore SVM concepts, kernel tricks, hyper-parameter tuning, and apply SVM to linear and non-linear datasets.
  
- **Lab 8:** 
  - **Feature Engineering and Cross-Validation:** Focus on feature engineering, k-Fold Cross-Validation, GridSearch CV, and Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV).
  
- **Lab 9:** 
  - **Heart Disease Prediction with Neural Networks:** Analyze the heart.csv dataset and design neural networks for classification.
